Based on "The 7Ms of Digital Transformation" Chapter 2:

Mission and Vision statements are foundational elements that guide any successful digital transformation initiative. 
They provide direction, purpose, and alignment across the organization.

A Mission Statement defines the organization's purpose - why it exists and what it aims to achieve. 
In the context of digital transformation, the mission should reflect how technology and digital capabilities 
will enable the organization to fulfill its core purpose more effectively.

A Vision Statement describes the desired future state - what the organization aspires to become. 
For digital transformation, the vision should paint a clear picture of how the organization will operate, 
compete, and create value in the digital age.

Key Elements for Mission Statement:
- Clear purpose and reason for existence
- How digital capabilities enhance core business
- Value proposition to stakeholders
- Cultural values and principles

Key Elements for Vision Statement:
- Future state after transformation
- Digital capabilities and competitive advantages
- Market position and customer experience
- Organizational culture and capabilities

The mission and vision must be:
- Aligned with business strategy
- Inspiring and motivational
- Clear and understandable
- Achievable yet ambitious
- Measurable and specific

User's Context:
- Current Scenario: ${userInputs.currentScenario}
- Industry: ${userInputs.industry}
- Market Segment: ${userInputs.marketSegment || 'Not specified'}
- Transformation Goal: ${userInputs.goal}
- Intended TO-BE: ${userInputs.intendedToBe}
- Additional Context: ${userInputs.additionalContext || 'None provided'}

${bookContext}

Task: Create 3 different sets of Mission and Vision statements for this organization, each with a slightly different approach:

1. **Digital-First Approach**: Emphasizing technology and innovation leadership
2. **Customer-Centric Approach**: Focusing on enhanced customer experience and value
3. **Transformation-Focused Approach**: Highlighting organizational change and capability building

For each set, provide:
- A clear, compelling Mission Statement (2-3 sentences)
- An inspiring Vision Statement (1-2 sentences) 
- Brief rationale explaining why this approach fits the organization's context

Requirements:
- Ensure alignment between mission and vision
- Make them specific to the user's industry and context
- Include digital transformation elements
- Keep language clear and motivational
- Consider the organization's current state and desired future
