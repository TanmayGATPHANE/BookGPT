# Implementation Summary: Mock Data System

## ✅ What Was Implemented

### 1. Environment Configuration
- Added `VITE_USE_REAL_API=false` to `.env` file
- Created TypeScript definitions for environment variables in `src/types/env.d.ts`

### 2. Mock Data Generation (`src/mocks/mockData.ts`)
- **Mission & Vision Mock Data**: 3 different approaches with dynamic content based on user inputs
- **Stakeholder Strategy Mock Data**: Complete SMILE Framework output matching the interface
- **Chat Mock Data**: Random responses simulating book-based conversations

### 3. Mock Service Layer (`src/mocks/mockService.ts`)
- Automatic switching between real API and mock data based on environment variable
- Simulated API delays for realistic testing
- Console logging to show current mode
- Wrapper functions for all API calls

### 4. Component Updates
Updated all components to use mock services:
- `WorkflowContainer.tsx` - Mission/vision and stakeholder strategy
- `App.tsx` - Chat functionality
- `ChatWindow.tsx` - Chat functionality

### 5. Documentation
- Created comprehensive README in `src/mocks/README.md`
- Documented usage, benefits, and configuration

## 🎛️ How to Use

### Development Mode (Default)
```bash
# In .env file
VITE_USE_REAL_API=false
```
- Fast development with instant responses
- No API calls made
- Consistent mock data

### Production Mode
```bash
# In .env file
VITE_USE_REAL_API=true
```
- Uses real backend API
- Requires backend server running on port 3004

## 🚀 Benefits Achieved

1. **Faster Development**: No waiting for API responses
2. **Testing**: Predictable, consistent responses
3. **Offline Development**: Works without backend
4. **API Conservation**: Saves API calls during development
5. **Easy Toggle**: Switch modes by changing one environment variable

## 🔍 Console Output

When running the application, you'll see:
```
🔧 API Mode: MOCK DATA
📝 Environment: development
🎛️ VITE_USE_REAL_API: false
```

## ✨ Next Steps

1. Test both mock and real API modes
2. Customize mock data as needed in `mockData.ts`
3. Add more mock scenarios if required
4. Use mock mode for UI development and testing

The system is now ready for development with mock data by default, and can easily switch to real API calls when needed!
